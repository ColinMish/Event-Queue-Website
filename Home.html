<h1>Data Structures: Event Queues</h1>
<p><b>What is an event queue?</b><br>
An event queue is a <i>data structure</i> that is used for <i>event handling</i> in <i>event driven applications and programming.</i> As the event handler is not always available due to it working on other events the events instead queue up in a data structure called an event queue and wait their turn to be processed by the event handler. Event handling is asynchronous meaning events <i>fire and forget</i>, they do not wait for a resolution before processing the next event in order to allow everything else to carry on working smoothly.
<br><br><b>What is an event?</b><br>
An event is an action (key press, mouse click, system occurrence etc) that is detected by the program and can then be handled by the event handler. A program that <i>changes its behaviour in response to events</i> is called <i>event-driven.</i> A fully event-driven program would be one that does not do anything until an event is detected such as a GUI.</p>
