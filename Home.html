	<h2>Event Queues</h2>
		<p><b>What is an event queue?</b><br>
		An event queue is a <i>data structure</i> that is used for <i>event handling</i> in <i>event driven applications and programming.</i> As the event handler is not always available due to it working on other events the events instead queue up in a data structure called an event queue and wait their turn to be processed by the event handler. Event handling is asynchronous meaning events <i>fire and forget</i>, they do not wait for a resolution before processing the next event in order to allow everything else to carry on working smoothly.

					<p><b> What is an event? </b><br><br>

					An event is an action (key press, mouse click, system occurrence etc) that is detected by the program and can then be handled by the program, usually with a synchronous approach. A program that changes its behaviour in response to events is called event-driven.</p>

	<h2> About the pattern </h2>
	<p> The event queue pattern is a decoupling design pattern (sometimes called  ‘message queue’, ‘event loop’, ‘message pump’). Decoupled code usually means it is easier to change one piece of code without breaking another. In the case of event queues, this usually refers to the two communicating objects (an event sender and an event handler).
	The pattern stores the event in a first-in-first-out order (queue) to handle them at a later time. The events can be handled directly or it can be routed to another party that might be better suited to handle that particular event.  <br> In short, an event queue can be described as a sort-of To-Do-list of of events that are waiting to be handled. </p>
	<br>

	<h2> Event Queues </h2>
<p>Queues can store two thing: Events - things that already happened (enemy slain), or Messages - things that you would like to happen in the future (play audio). One is in the past (events) and the other is in the future (messages) so to speak.
Anything in an event queue has already happened. <br>
In a video game where you slay an enemy an event “entity slain” is triggered and added to the event queue. This event however needs time to work its way to the front of the queue and then additional information is needed - what entity was slain? Is that information still available or has the entity just been deleted? How much experience does the player get? What other events need to be triggered now (drop loot, victory music, start cutscene)? Especially on destructive events such as slaying an enemy care must be taken to record the information so that the event can be handled properly when it gets to the front of the queue.
For a queue that stores events, you will most likely have multiple entities listening in on it. A messages queue on the other hand will probably only have one listener. The word “single-cast” is used to describe the single listener queue while “broadcast” is usually used for a multi-listener queue. The event queue can be either or. <br>
<br>
A multi-listener queue can also be a “work” queue.  The difference between a “work” queue and a “broadcast” queue is, while in a “broadcast” queue every listener receives the sent event, in a “work” queue each one of the listeners receives only one of the items in the event queue (another way to phrase it is that an event only goes to one listener). This requires some sort of scheduling system, in order to select the best listener for the job.
